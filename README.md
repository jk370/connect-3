# connect-3
Q-Learning, Minimax and Expectiminimax for a reduced version of connect 4. This game is played on a 5x3 board with a random opponent always playing first. The aim is to connect 3 of the same tiles to win.

The implemented algorithms to learn an optimal policy are standard Q-Learning, Minimax (with alpha-beta pruning) and Expectiminimax against the random opponent. 

Packages used are numpy and matplotlib (pyplot).
